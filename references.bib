    abstract    = "The Robustness Diagram with Loop and Time Controls is a multidimensional workflow diagram capable of representing the resource, process, and case dimensions in one model. To improve support for its automated verification, a method of model decomposition to Petri net through mapping components to Petri net components was defined in previous literature. This mapping however is not complete with respect to model components that help control the reachability or reuse of substructures therein. Furthermore, the mapping also outputs unsound PNs. This research addresses these gaps in the mapping of Robustness Diagram with Loop and Time Controls to Petri nets. Additionally, both mappings are checked and compared for both classical and relaxed soundness in order to glean insight into the implications of mapping Robustness Diagram with Loop and Time Controls to Petri nets with respect to soundness across workflow models.",
